My rendition of my favorite TI-85 calculator game


What is Falldown?
-----------------
Falldown is a game in which you guide a ball through gaps in a rising floor.  If the ball gets squashed at the
top of the screen, the game ends.


What else?
----------
These seem like leading questions.. Uhm, Falldown Rebirth is mostly open-source.  As of this writing, all of the
game's source code is available via GitHub.  However, there is some supporting source code (for e.g., vector math
and collision detection) that I have not put up on GitHub yet.
